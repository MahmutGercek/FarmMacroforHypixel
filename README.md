# PLEASE READ THIS AREA
Okay so this is basically a macro especially made for afk farming on servers, still on improving it only works for pumpkin and melon farms at the moment and read the descriptions on keyloop.java and mcmod.info

You need to use gradle version 4.9 and java 8 for them being compatible AND THOSE ONLY REQUIRED IF YOU WANNA RUN THE MOD ON ./gradlew runClient, you dont have to get gradle or something else for making the mod work

Thanks for your attention
